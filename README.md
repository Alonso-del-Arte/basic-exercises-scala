# Basic Exercises in Scala

This one's like the one for Java. For the most part object-oriented with some 
functional mixed in, with tests for most "concrete" classes and maybe even some 
abstract classes and traits (interfaces).

For testing Scala I use JUnit 5. I started this project with JUnit 4, but since 
IntelliJ IDEA has JUnit 5, I might as well use the newer framework. There might 
be some stragglers in the switch-over.

I'm aware of ScalaTest and I may use it in the future. This project might 
provide some good opportunities for that.

I might refer to this repository in my Medium articles. I might also make 
free-standing excerpts into "Gists" apart from this project.

NOTE: The `src/basicexercises` and `test/basicexercises` are for ignored files 
in which I (or anyone who forks this repository) can do very basic exercises 
without over-burdening the repository. 

NOTE: I deleted the `chess` package because I intend to move it to its own 
repository. I don't intend to create a fully working chess game, but I do 
intend to develop it more than is appropriate for a basic exercises repository.

NOTE: I will be renaming the master branch "main."

NOTE, 14 SEPTEMBER 2021: I reinstated the `chess` package because I decided to 
use it for an example of sealed classes. But the vast majority of my chess 
programming will be in my dedicated chess repository.
