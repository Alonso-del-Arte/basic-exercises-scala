# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

If I do decide to open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021, I may consider pull 
requests associated with an issue and maybe consider pull requests associated 
with a TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans).

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) with a 
Scala plugin, and JUnit. I strongly recommend IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala for 
IntelliJ plugin. I don't recommend NetBeans only because the Scala plugin is 
not yet ready NetBeans 12. 

This project uses Scala 2.13 (and Java 8) and JUnit 5. Contributors may use 
later versions of Scala or Java provided they don't use features not available 
Scala 2 or in Java 8.
